## Hi there 👋

<!--
# 👋 Hi, welcome to TechTailor32

I'm a builder at heart — part developer, part systems thinker, part strategist. My work sits at the intersection of technical depth and business value: I love connecting tools, teams, and ideas to turn smart code into real outcomes.

## 🧰 Tools & Tech

My go-to stack includes Python, SQL, Power Automate, REST APIs, and Jupyter Notebooks — tools that let me move quickly from concept to execution. I use AI (LLMs like ChatGPT), automation, and API-driven integration to connect systems, reduce manual effort, and surface insights that matter.

I'm comfortable working across environments and adapting to the tools a team is already using. I've worked with Microsoft Fabric, Databricks, and a variety of analytics and orchestration platforms, always with a focus on driving clarity, reducing friction, and building something that lasts.

Whether it's a quick prototype or a full-scale implementation, I prioritize scalable structure, thoughtful documentation, and solutions that make sense both technically and strategically.

## 🧠 My Development Philosophy

I approach development with both a keyboard and a whiteboard mindset. I enjoy prototyping, testing, and refining — but always with the bigger picture in mind. I focus on extensible solutions that scale and integrate well into the business fabric. I’m not just asking “does it run?” — I’m asking “does it drive value, reduce friction, or unlock something new?”

I’ve led and contributed to projects that range from quick wins to foundational system overhauls. My role often involves helping stakeholders understand what tech can do, and helping dev teams build it in a way that sticks.

## 🤝 Let's Collaborate

I’m always open to exchanging ideas, pairing on projects, or exploring where emerging tools (like LLMs and automation) can level up legacy systems or manual processes.  
If you’re solving hard problems with thoughtful code — or trying to explain tech to non-technical folks — we’ll probably get along.
